### Hi there 👋

I mainly write Clojure (I've been writing it full-time since 2013). I don't do much of open source these days (corpo life) and my time outside of work is a bunch of non-technical things (maintaining balance, y'all).

### Not programming
------------------
😄 Pronouns: she/her

🥾 I love hiking and backpacking (slowly getting into ultra light)

🎮 I spend hundreds of hours playing open world RPGs

🧵 I cosplay, though rarely (X-Wing pilot, Rey, Jedi, Yennefer)

⚡ I read and watch a lot of sci-fi, Slavic mythology, fantasy

🏋️‍♀️ Weight lifting and spinning bike help me stay healthy
